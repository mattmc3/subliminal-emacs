* Subliminal Emacs

** Manifesto
- Emacs is a great editor and has stood the test of time
- Emacs is not very easy to use out of the box and adheres to its own standards
- Emacs is infinitely configurable, and configuring it to work the way you want it to is encouraged
- [[https://www.sublimetext.com][Other editors]] are also great, but not always open source, or development is super slow, and may not stand the test of time
- Emacs can be adapted to work more like [[https://www.sublimetext.com][other editors]] to make it easier to adapt to
- Making Emacs work like other editors is not wrong, and in fact can make Emacs more accessible to more people
- When there's a reason to do it "the Emacs way", it should be easy to remove the emulation
- Emacs is your editor, use it your way!
