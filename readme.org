* Subliminal Emacs

** Manifesto
- Emacs is a great editor that has stood the test of time
- Emacs is not very easy to use out of the box and stubbornly adheres to its own outmoded standards
- Emacs is infinitely configurable, and configuring it to work the way you want it to is encouraged, but not easy for new users
- [[https://www.sublimetext.com][Other editors]] are also great, but may not be open source, development stagnates, may not run on your platform, or may not stand the test of time
- Emacs can be adapted to work more like [[https://www.sublimetext.com][other editors]], which can make it easier to use and adopt for users familiar with those editors
- Making Emacs work like other editors is not wrong-headed, and in fact shows its power to adapt and can make it accessible to more people
- When there comes a time to do it "the Emacs way", it should be easy to remove the emulation
- Emacs is your editor, use it your way!
